Packages to be there on the machine to run this Program

1. NLTK to be installed.
2. NumPy
3. Scikit-Learn
4. nltk_data in the home directory of the linux system.
5. Jupyter IPython Notebook

The program is very well optimized by storing Term Frequency Matrix in "TermDocStemmed.mtx" and Features(tokens) of use to us in later part of program in "Vocabulary.csv" and are loaded later from these files.

1)So you can skip the cells 4,5,6.
2)Keeping in view the ease of use,efficiency,computer constraints the program is built in a way you can skip cells 4,5,6.

QUERY INPUT: You will be asked to make query in cell 15.


FILES IN THE ZIP - 
1. Information Retrieval Using Vector Space Model
2. TermDocStemmed.mtx
3. Vocabulary.csv
